When player is saved, their boxes (if any) are saved and put on the list, when char is being written to file, their box (if found on list) is written then both mfs are removed from list and freed.
- Added 'printlist' command for lvl 110 which tracks status of mf lists (player_save_list, box_mf_list, player_quit_list).

- container full message when using put all.


12/21/2012 Astark
- Added remorts 6 and 7. Also matched chambers on our port to main port although I'm not certain speed chambers are assigned to the right clone of each remort, but this shouldn't matter unless someone is in remort when the change is made
